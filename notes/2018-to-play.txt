September



Summer has finally ended and we are well and truly heading into autumn. September officially was the start of that period, of course, which meant getting our hands on plenty of big games.

Games like Spider-Man, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Destiny 2: Forsaken, Life is Strange 2, and Dragon Quest 11. That only scratches the surface of what September had in store for us, though. Smaller, more niche titles like SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy, and Valkyria Chronicles 4 were also ones to watch.

And just like every year, September 2018 was FIFA month, but FIFA 19 was far from alone in the sports category. NBA 2K19, NBA Live 19, and NHL 19 all dropped during the month.

October



We made it, folks! Welcome to the hottest season of the year for games. Practically anything major left is coming out in October. The list may look smaller than previous months, but it is loaded with AAA games.

The most anticipated one of them has to be Red Dead Redemption 2, followed by Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey, Soulcalibur 6, and Starlink: Battle for Atlas.

Assuming you have any money left after that opening salvo, you may want to check out Forza Horizon 4, Mega Man 11, For Honor’s first DLC in months – and Call of Cthulhu on the smaller-budget side.
